# ColorStorm
A simple and light way to find info about a color

# Some more info
Building some GUI for web or desktop app, sometimes, I had the need to find a good color and its related information, of course the color could have be found using photoshop, gimp or any other graphic software, but they are often heavy. I made this tool to have a light way to find my needed colors. This is one of the very few tools I really used, not one of those I made just for curiosity or tests... and it is colorful!

Have a nice day :)
